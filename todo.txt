Because this is going to require a bit of preplanning, I'm going to make myself a todo:

----

To-Do:

* Figure out how the source code works, first of all
* Figure out about the keyboard emulation required for Daisywheel to function
* Implement some OSK like graphical typing aid (similar to the original Daisywheel one)
** Make the layout configurable
** Make custom graphics possible
** Customizable daisywheel layouts
** Preferrably have the above in the likes of an XML file
* Figure out the parts required for Daisywheel functionality to work
** "Dial", "Stick", or whatever the segment selector should be called.
*** Perhaps configure this to possibly be four way
** "Mode buttons", essentially replicating the functionality found on the shoulders (special characters, capitals, numbers...)
*** Ability to toggle those
** "Pad", ie the buttons used to actually type the letters out
*** Customizable layout to these, and possibly more than four buttons per pad (see Genesis six button controller for an example)


Done:

Optional/lower priority to-do:

* Figure out how to make one controller affect another, perhaps some sort of mode shifting
** Possibly a split-controller daisywheel


Done:
