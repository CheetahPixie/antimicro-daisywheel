Note to self about current issues with the project, requiring immediate solutions.

1: Get this to compile qith Qt5, somehow.
  As far as cursory investigation shows, there are apparently a bunch of undefined things all over for this to work. Probably not a difficult fix.
2: Learn C++ enough to be able to do what I need to be doing.
